# All about my Outreachy experience!

Since, I made a commitment to myself to write a blog post about my learning experiences, here I am again. Since then I came to share something different and cool about remote opportunities in the Top Tech companies.
I've been busy since last Tuesday with my Outreachy Projects. Now you're probably curious _"what the heck is [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org)?"_, so let me explain.

Outreachy is a really cool Open Source program that is out there to give minorities a chance to get their first professional tech internship with some really cool groups like: Mozilla, Tor, Linux, Apache, Debian and the list goes on.
Another really cool thing is that you can be from ***ANYWHERE around the globe*** because the internship is remote. If you face any discrimination, are under-represented or you experience bias against you in the tech idustry and by your country, you are welcome to apply. So, as a Muslim and a Pakistani, I am a perfect candidate.

***So how it works, you ask?***

They open the program 2 times a year (January and August) and you have a little over a month to apply. If you are approved, the next step is the contribution period. You choose one or two projects that match your skills and you think would be cool to work on, and you have a month to make a contribution to said project.
If in the end of the process the Mentor of your project chooses you as their Pokemon (or intern) you get 3 months of paid internship working from home with the super cool project you choose to contribute to. Isn't that amazing!?
So yes, that is what has been all over my mind. The contribution period started last week, and DUDE there are tons of good projects. But honestly, only a few that are good for me. My skills being HTML/CSS/JavaScript and some React. I am currently working on a bug for one project [Task Cluster](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster) and thinking about how I will contribute for a second one, and let me tell you it is **NOT*** easy. But I am learning a lot in the process, and that is the main goal of the program.

I ***REALLY*** want this internship so you guys, wish me luck!

Also, the next round application starts in January 2020 so if you think it is a good fit for you, follow them on twitter [@outreachy](https://twitter.com/outreachy) and check out the Applicants Guide for more info.
If you have any questions about Outreachy of or you want to wish me good Luck, you are more than welcome!

***Hope you all are having a good day and thanks for reading!***
