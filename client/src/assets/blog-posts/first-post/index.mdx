# Hey!

This is my first post! Here, I'm going to write about my journey in the domain of software development.
Since I graduated in December of 2018 I started job hunting and I found multiple job offers from other
cities that I couldn't accept being that I belong to an underprivileged city (I live in Pakistan) and traveling is difficult. 
Though that's really unfortunate, I still have a passion to utilize my skills and education so 
I decided it may be better to find some remote work. Luckily I found some resources where I can start to polish my skills 
and build a strong portfolio for good remote opportunities. I've completed some online certifications, 
connected with other remote workers in the field, made small projects, comlpeted a remote inetrnship, gave
myself *time* and participated in some coding challenges. After, I started working on some personal 
development projects for better performance. In the world of software development I've learned all 
you need is a lot of **practice** and **consitency**. In the end I would like to send a special
thank you to my mentor [Ruben](https://rubenprofit.nyc), who's always there to help whenever I get
stuck!

Moral is: _if you have the curiousity of learning, you can find your own way and good things will definitely come!_

Here's some learning resources that might be helpful for those who want to build their development skills.
