<h1>#My first Blog-Post </h1>


<p>This is my first post . I 'm  going to write about my struggle for remote opportunities in a domain of Full Stack Development  .
Since, I graduated in December ,18  . After the graduation I started job hunting and i found a  multiple job offers from   other cities as I belong to an unprevilaged city And  i won't be able to travel that's really unfortunate for me  but i have a passion to utilize my skills and education so i decided to find some remote work and luckily i find some resources from where i can start polish my skills and build my strong profile for good remote opportunities,  so , I do online certifications , build   networking with remote workers with the same field , make small projects ,did a remote inetrnship ,  give myself 'Time' , participate in a coding challenges  because in the world of Development all you need is to <strong>'practice'</strong> only  .  later on , I started working on my personal development for the better  performance . In the End i Would like to  Especial Thanks to my Mentor <strong>"Robin Profit"</strong> who's always behind my back whenever i stuck . </p>
