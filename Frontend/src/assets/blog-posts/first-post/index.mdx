#Hey!

This is my first post! Here, I'm going to write about my journies in the domain of Full Stack Development.
Since I graduated in December of 2018 I started job hunting and I found multiple job offers from other cities that I couldn't acceptas I belong to an unprevilaged city and I won't be able to travel. Though that's really unfortunate for me, I still have a passion to utilize my skills and education so I decided to find some remote work. Luckily I found some resources where I can start to polish my skills and build a strong profile for good remote opportunities. I've completed some online certifications, connected with remote workers in the field, made small projects, comlpeted a remote inetrnship, gave myself 'time' and participated in coding challenges. Later on, I started working on some personal development projects for better performance. In the world of software development I've learned all you need is a lot of **practice** and **consitency**. In the end I would like to send a special thank you to my mentor [Ruben](https://rubenprofit.nyc), who's always behind my back whenever i get stuck!

Moral is: _if you have the curiousity of learning, you can find your own way and good things will definitely come!_

Here's some learning resources that might be helpful for those who want to build their development skills.
